*   **Data Aggregation:** Merge lists or dictionaries, eliminate duplicates, and flatten nested lists.
*   **Random Generation:** Create unique random strings for various purposes.
*   **Pattern Matching:** Check for partial or complete element presence within collections.
*   **Formatting & Conversion:** Format durations, reverse objects (strings, lists), and convert text to URL-friendly slugs.
*   **Text Analysis:** Count words and characters, detect various case styles, and split text into individual words.
*   **Case Transformation:** Seamlessly convert text between `snake_case`, `kebab-case`, `PascalCase`, `camelCase`, `CONSTANT_CASE`, and `Title Case`.
*   **Palindrome Checks:** Verify if a string or sequence is a palindrome.

### üñºÔ∏è Advanced Data & Image Processing

Specialized tools for handling images and large datasets with HDF5:

*   **Image Augmentation:** Apply a wide array of transformations to images (rotation, scaling, mirroring, blurring, noise, contrast, brightness, resizing, inversion) for data enhancement or creative effects.
*   **Image Analysis:** Calculate similarity between images and blend multiple images together.
*   **HDF5 Integration:** Efficiently read and write image and label data to and from HDF5 files, ideal for machine learning classification tasks.

### üß† The `trc` Agent: Your Intelligent Assistant (Total Resource Control!)

At the core of `trc`'s advanced capabilities lies its integrated AI Agent, truly embodying the "Total Resource Control" philosophy. This powerful agent is designed to interact with its environment and execute complex tasks autonomously, leveraging a diverse set of specialized tools:

*   **User Interaction (`ask_user`):** The agent can engage in a dialogue with users, asking for clarification or necessary input to proceed with tasks.
*   **File Management (`filetools`):** Comprehensive control over the file system, including reading, writing, appending, listing, creating, and deleting files and directories.
*   **System Command Execution (`shell executor`):** Ability to run arbitrary shell commands, granting the agent full control over the underlying operating system for advanced automation.
*   **Knowledge Retrieval (`wiki tool`):** Access to a vast knowledge base through Wikipedia, enabling the agent to research and gather information on demand.
*   **Multimedia Processing (`image, audio, video reader`):** Capabilities to ingest and process various multimedia formats, including images, audio, and video, for analysis or manipulation.
*   **Persistent Data Storage (`database`):** A robust internal database allows the agent to store and retrieve information for long-term memory, learning, and persistent operations.
*   **Large File & Structure Analysis (`pattern_recognizer/big_file_reader`):** Specialized tools for efficiently reading and understanding large files and complex folder structures, crucial for big data handling and deep analysis.

This intelligent agent transforms `trc` from a mere collection of utilities into a dynamic, problem-solving entity, ready to tackle challenges that require adaptive decision-making and broad operational capabilities.

## üéØ Quick Usage Examples

Here's a glimpse of what you can do with `trc`:

```python
import trc
from PIL import Image

# Example 1: Download an image
try:
    img = trc.download_image("https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png")
    img.save("google_logo.png")
    print("Google Logo downloaded and saved.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error downloading image: {e}")

# Example 2: Get system information
sys_info = trc.sysinfo()
print(f"Operating System: {sys_info['os']}")
print(f"CPU Model: {sys_info['cpu_model']}")

# Example 3: Find the Nth prime number
prime_number = trc.nprime(7)
print(f"The 7th prime number is: {prime_number}")

# Example 4: Copy and retrieve text from clipboard
try:
    trc.clipboard_set("Hello from trc!")
    copied_text = trc.clipboard_get()
    print(f"Text from clipboard: {copied_text}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error with clipboard operation: {e}")

# Example 5: Merge two lists (removing duplicates)
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [3, 4, 5]
merged_list = trc.merge(list1, list2, duplicate=False)
print(f"Merged list (no duplicates): {merged_list}")

# Example 6: Generate a random string
random_str = trc.random_string(10)
print(f"Random string: {random_str}")

# Example 7: Slugify text
text_to_slug = "This is an Example Text for a Slug!"
slug = trc.slugify(text_to_slug)
print(f"Slug: {slug}")

# Example 8: Basic image augmentation
try:
    dummy_img = Image.new('RGB', (100, 100), color = (73, 109, 137))
    augmented_img = trc.image_augmentation(dummy_img, rotation=45, blur=2)
    augmented_img.save("augmented_dummy_image.png")
    print("Dummy image augmented and saved.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error with image augmentation: {e}")
```
